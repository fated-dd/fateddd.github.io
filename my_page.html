            <h2>Social distancing guidelines flouted at Biden inauguration</h2>
        <p>
            The ceremony for the inauguration of President Biden was sparsely attended due to concerns over coronavirus, but the notable figures who were there did not always appear to follow social distancing guidelines.

            While attendees, including former presidents and first ladies, wore face masks, they did not always stay six feet apart and in a number of cases were seen high-fiving, hugging or otherwise in close contact.
